            "2. **Subfields**: AI has several subfields, including:\n",
            "\t* **Machine Learning (ML)**: a type of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
            "\t* **Deep Learning (DL)**: a subset of ML that uses neural networks to analyze data.\n",
            "\t* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: a subfield of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language.\n",
            "\t* **Computer Vision**: a subfield of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual data from images and videos.\n",
            "3. **Key Concepts**: Some important concepts in AI include:\n",
            "\t* **Neural Networks**: a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.\n",
            "\t* **Supervised Learning**: a type of ML where the system is trained on labeled data to learn from examples.\n",
